  ----------------------------------
  What I do not know

  How the resulting evaluation of a 
  boolean expression knows when to 
  return (True or False) or (0 or 1)

  why does it return 4 1's when an input 
  of 3 characters is entered in a while loop implementation

  Why does getchar return no output

  Why putchar returns input text one at a time and
  how does it go to a newline after enter is pressed

  simpler solution
